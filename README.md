# No DB project

This project keeps track of bills. It was build using a node server and a React Front-End.

One can enter bills which will first appear in the unpaid bills section. If you pay them, they will be listed under the paid bills sections and removed from the unpaid list. You also have the option to delete the bills.

The app also keeps a running total of the paid and unpaid bills

The app is responsive and will adjust to different screen sizes.

In order to run it, you need to start both the react app and the node server: nodemon index.js ; npm start
